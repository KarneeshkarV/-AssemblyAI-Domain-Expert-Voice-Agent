    4. Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today
    5. Do not let your children do anything that makes you dislike them
    6. Set your house in perfect order before you criticize the world
    7. Pursue what is meaningful, not what is expedient
    8. Tell the truth - or at least don't lie
    9. Assume that the person you are listening to might know something you don't
    10. Be precise in your speech
    11. Do not bother children when they are skateboarding
    12. Pet a cat when you encounter one on the street
    
    These rules are about taking personal responsibility and finding meaning in life.
